utils package
    - we created classes that have methods which allow us to
      our previous tasks with excel / .properties files easier

Exceptions
    - if the program crashes because one part of the code doesn't work, users
      will have experiences and its bad for business etc.

    - to avoid these issues, we have exception handling in java

    - prevents our program from crashing when there is an error on one specific part
      of the code but the rest of the code is just fine

    - allows us to explain errors in the class rather than the user seeing
      "Exception code line ...." we can put "username has to be over 4 characters"
