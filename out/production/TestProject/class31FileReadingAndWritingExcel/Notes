If we have to read data from file on computer
    - we need to know the location of that file and navigate there
    - we need a software that understands how the data is stored in those files
To create a new directory
    - right click on project, go to new --> directory

- when creating a file inside a directory, you must give name
  first then extension as .properties like (config.properties)

why do we need .properties file
    - we use them to store info like usernames, URLs passwords etc. so that this info is secured
      and not pushed to github
    - when we use selenium, sometimes we hard code in private values like usernames and passwords
      but this is not good if we're in a public team with a lot of people accessing the repository
      so, instead of putting the private info in the program, we store those values in a file inside
      a directory, and we do not push those those files to the repository ("git ignore")

How to get path of a file from IntelliJ
    - Right click on file, copy path reference, path from content root
    - if the above relative path doesn't work, use the absolute path

- Properties class is a child of map so we are able to use those methods
- note excel rows start at 1, 2, 3 but to java, it is 0, 1 , 2
  (even the colummns)
- colummns are called cells in excel
- excel files are very important on the jobs
