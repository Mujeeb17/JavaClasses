Super keyword recap:
    Is used to refer to the parent class members like fields methods and constructors

When we should use 'super' or 'this' keyword:
    whenever sam name field field/method exists inside the parent & child class, we can
    use super to refer to parent

Method Overloading
    happens when same name method exists in a class with different parameters

    - It's a mechanism in java that allows us to have multiple methods with the same name
      but different parameters.
    - understand that when you call a method, the method is checking which parameters are being passed

    We can overload methods in 3 ways:
    1) by changing the number of parameters in a method
    2) by changing the data types
    3) by changing the sequence of parameters

why should we overload a method or constructor?
    method overloading allows us to reuse the method name so that way we don't need
    to bother coming up with different names if we are doing the same thing again and again.
    - its cleaner code, more readability and flexibility for end user.

    - upcasting??

Some important things before selenium:
    if/else conditions
    loops
    arrays
    methods
    String class methods (Ignore StringBuffer)
    Inheritance
