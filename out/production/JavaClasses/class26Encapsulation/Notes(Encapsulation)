Encapsulation
    the idea of encapsulation provides a better way to organise code
    for modifying it later.

    the idea also says to create classes and not
    put all your code in the main method.

    encapsulation is about privacy and hiding data. its binding variables with
    methods (setters and getters)

    it says make getter and setter methods so you have more control over
    the values you want others to access (so that your classes are more secure)
        - we can make public methods that are able to either set or get private variables

    - it's a good practice to make fields private so that other classes
      won't be able to modify it.

    - 'get' methods are the ones that only display private fields without modifying them
        - 'get' methods should have a return type same as variable you are 'getting'

    - 'set' methods allow us to modify the fields (usually with certain if conditions)
        - 'set' methods are usually void because you shouldn't be returning anything,
          you are only setting the value

    - you can automatically make 'get' and 'set' methods through 'generate' with intellij

    The main advantage of using of encapsulation is
    to secure the data from other methods, when we
    make a data private then these data only use
    within the class, but these data not accessible
    outside the class.
    - this gives you more control over the values so that they can't be changed without you knowing
