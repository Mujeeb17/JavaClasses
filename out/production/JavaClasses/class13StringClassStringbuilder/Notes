When we should use String Class:
    when we want to save as much memory as possible, and we are okay if the programs get a little slow.
When should we use StringBuilder Class:
    when we want maximum speed, and we don't care how much memory our programs going to occupy.
What does it mean by String is immutable:
    It means Strings are not changeable once created in the memory of the computer, and the reason they are
    immutable is that same memory cell can be shared across many variables and if we allow any of the
    variable to change the value it can break the complete system.

    String objects are immutable, meaning that once a String object is created,
    its value cannot be changed. If you need to modify a string, you must
    create a new String object with the modified value.

    A StringBuilder is a class in Java that is used to build strings dynamically.
    Unlike built-in strings, StringBuilder objects are mutable, meaning that
    you can modify their value without creating a new object. StringBuilder
    provides a set of methods for appending, inserting, and deleting characters from the string.
