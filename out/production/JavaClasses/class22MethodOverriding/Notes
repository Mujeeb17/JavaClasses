Method Overriding (Completely different from method overloading)
    It's a mechanism in java that allows a sub class to provide a
    specific implementation of a method.
    - can only happen with inheritance

Why we should override a method?
    If a sub class doesn't like the implementation of the parent class, it has the flexibility
    that it can override that method.
    - if we

    - lets say we are inheriting 10 methods from a parent class but we only like 9,
    so what we can do is keep the 9 the way they are, and the last one, we can override
    the method so that its more useful for the subclass

Rules:
    1) There must be a parent child relationship between two classes
    2) If something can't be inherited, we can't override it. For example private methods
    or constructors.
    3) Visibility of an overridden method can be increased, for ex: if something has
    default or protected access, we can't make it private, we could only make it public if needed
    4) static methods can't be overridden, they can be re-declared

Redeclaration vs overriding
    redeclaring and overriding is the same thing but we only use the term re-declaring for things that
    are static


Note:
    Inheritance is mostly discouraged because of tight coupling
    - tightly coupling is when one class is very dependant on another class and in a
    situation where there are many devs working one project, they have to be
    aware of what they might be changing in a parent class because it has
    the potential to mess up a lot of sub classes

    - Inheritance can cause problems with code because it makes classes
    dependent on each other, it can limit flexibility, create complicated
    relationships, break expected behavior, and result in overcomplex
    code if used too much

    - We CAN overload the main method because technically its just another method BUT, we
    CANNOT override the main method, we can only re-declare it

    - A SIGNATURE IN PROGRAMMING TERMINOLOGY IS THE METHOD NAME AND ITS PARAMETERS
