Super keyword recap:
    Is used to refer to the parent class members like fields methods and constructors

When we should use 'super' or 'this' keyword:
    whenever sam name field field/method exists inside the parent & child class, we can
    use super to refer to parent

Method Overloading
    happens when same name method exists in a class with different parameters

    We can overload methods in 3 ways:
    1) by changing the number of parameters in a method
    2) by changing the data types
    3) by changing the sequence of parameters

why should we overload a method or constructor?
    Clean code and flexibility to end user
