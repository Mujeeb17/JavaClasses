Type casting, for instance:

You are trying to make an INTEGER into the DOUBLE
(which is a bigger data type) therefore you type it like this.

int nameOfTheVariable = (here you type in again the same data
type that already is so you let Java know that you are aware of
what you are doing) 12.5; => 12.5 represents a double value.
