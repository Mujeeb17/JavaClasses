Sets (Set interface)

    Sets are a part of the Collections framework. Sets like HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet
    don't allow duplicate values. There are 3 main types of Sets.

HashSet

    HashSet doesn't allow duplicate values. and it doesn't maintain order.

    Note: wherever you see "hash" order of elements are not maintained.

LinkedHashSet

    LinkedHasSet does maintain order but its slower than HashSet

TreeSet

    TreeSet removes duplicate values and sorts the data but doesn't maintain order
    (different way of sorting based on the data type). It's the slowest Set.

Maps (Map interface)

    Maps are NOT  a part of the collections framework so it has different methods for the same tasks for ex: instead
    of add() we now use put(). Maps have keys and values which must be specified in the diamond operators
    when we create the object.
    - Think of the keys in a map is the same as the index in an array
    - Maps are not index based
