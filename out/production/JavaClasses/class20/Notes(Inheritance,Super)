Inheritance:
    - process when subclass aqcuires properties and methods from super/parent class
    - we use this for code reusability
    - we do this with the 'extends' keyword

Inheritance Types:
    Single - 1 child 1 parent
    Multilevel - grandparent, parent, subclass, sub-subclass etc.
    Hierarchical - 1 parent, multiple children

Access modifier & Inheritance
    if a parent class has a private method/variable, any sub class WON'T have those
    (private members don't participate in inheritance)

    default members are only visible in the same package.

    protected members are only visible in the same package UNLESS, there is a
    subclass and parent class in different packages (only avaialable outside packages
    through inheritance).

    public members are available everywhere.

Super
    - from a child class constructor, THERE IS ALWAYS going to be a call to the parent class constructor
    - ALL CLASSES IN JAVA HAVE A PARENT CLASS. who is parent?: parent class of all classes is Object class(Built-in by default)
    - Object class is super class of all classes in java (this is the reason we see many available methods
      methods we can use when we use '.'
    - we can use super keyword
