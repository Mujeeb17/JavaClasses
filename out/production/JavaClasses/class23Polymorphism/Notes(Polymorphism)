Polymorphism
    poly means many, morph means forms
    - many forms!

    Polymorphism is one of the OOPs feature that allows
    us to perform a single action in different ways.

    Polymorphism is the capability of a method to do
    different things based on the object that it is acting
    upon.

    An important usage of polymorphism occurs in oops
    is how a parent class refers to a child class object.

    Polymorphism can be achieved in two of the
    following ways:
        1. Compile time Polymorphism/Static Binding
           through Method Overloading
        2. Run time Polymorphism/ Dynamic Binding
           through Method Overriding

    Upcasting: Casting from a subclass to a
    superclass is called upcasting
    Downcasting: Itâ€™s the casting from a superclass
    to a subclass.
