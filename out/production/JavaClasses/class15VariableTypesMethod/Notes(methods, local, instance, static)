Methods in Java:
    Is just a collection of java statements and blocks of code.
    Methods in java are just a block of code which performs a specific
    task and it can be called upon later in a program

Why should we learn about methods:
    1) it allows us to simplify large code as we can divide
    the logic into smaller parts by creating methods for them.
    build those methods one by one and later combine them
    to build the complete application.
    2) Methods allow us to re-use code
    3) Methods allow us to be flexible

How can we create Methods
    2 types of methods: built-in and user defined

Built-in methods:
    The methods which are designed by java developers for ex: println(), nextLine(), length().

User-defined method:
    The methods that we write.

Methods which return something when called and
others are methods which do not return anything when called.

int add(int a, int b){
    return a+b;
}

int => return type of a method
add => name of the method
(int a, int b) => parameters of the method or input to the method

Rules:
    return type and values we are returning from a method should match.
    we can only assign methods to variables of same type
************************************************************
There are 3 types of variables with respect to their scope
local variables:
    if a variable is created inside a block of code like a method, loop, if condition etc.
    they are called local variables

    Upside: local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time.
    You should always try to write code with local variables.
    Downside: they can't be accesed outside of the block in which they are created in

instance variables:
    all variables created inside a class outside a method
    are called instance variables

    Upside: we can use them in all the instance methods of that class. their scope is
    larger than local variables.

    Downside: they stay longer in the memory compared to local variables
Static variables:
    all variables that are outside of methods and have the static keyword are static variables
