Methods in Java:
    Is just a collection of java statements and blocks of code

Why should we learn about methods:
    1) it allows us to simplify large code as we can divide
    the logic into smaller parts by creating methods for them.
    build those methods one by one and later combine them
    to build the complete application.
    2) Methods allow us to re-use code
    3) Methods allow us to be flexible

How can we create Methods
    2 types of methods: built-in and user defined

Built-in methods:
    The methods which are designed by java developers for ex: println(), nextLine(), length().

User-defined method:
    The methods that we write.

Methods which return something when called and
others are methods which do not return anything when called.

int add(int a, int b){
    return a+b;
}

int => return type of a method
add => name of the method
(int a, int b) => parameters of the method or input to the method

Rules:
    return type and values we are returning from a method should match.
    we can only assign methods to variables of same type
