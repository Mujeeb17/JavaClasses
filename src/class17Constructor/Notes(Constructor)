Access modifiers recap:
    They control the accessibility of methods anc classes
    4 levels: private, protected, default, public
Constructors:
    Constructors help us create objects easily or initialise the instance fields of a class
    in a better way.

Rules:
    1) they are similar to methods, but they don't have return types
    2) They have the same name as class name
    3) We can use all the access modifiers with the constructors
    4) static keyword is not allowed with constructors

    You are able to create more than one constructor for EX: one constructor
    takes 2 parameters, the other one takes 3. Even though they have to have the
    same name, Java will know which constructor you want to use based on how many
    parameters you have when creating the object, or the sequence of parameters

    - Constructor is a block of code that is executed when we create an object
    - There is no return type in constructors
    - 2 types of Constructors: 1. non argument(). 2. with parameters
