Polymorphism
    poly means many, morph means forms
    - many forms!

    Polymorphism is one of the OOPs feature that allows
    us to perform a single action in different ways.

    Polymorphism is the capability of a method to do
    different things based on the object that it is acting
    upon.

    An important usage of polymorphism occurs in oops
    is how a parent class refers to a child class object.

    Polymorphism can be achieved in two of the
    following ways:
        1. Compile time Polymorphism/Static Binding
           through Method Overloading
        2. Run time Polymorphism/ Dynamic Binding
           through Method Overriding

    Upcasting: Casting from a subclass to a
    superclass is called upcasting
    Downcasting: Itâ€™s the casting from a superclass
    to a subclass.

Final Keyword
    if someone tries to change the value of a 'final' variable
    later in a program, they will get an error. we should use 'final'
    keyword when we want the value to never change.
    - Also works with methods amd classes

    - we can't override final methods
    - if we use 'final' keyword with a class, no class can inherit from it
