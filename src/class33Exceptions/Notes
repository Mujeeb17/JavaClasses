Exceptions continued
    - : an unwanted behaviour in programs which occur at runtime
      and make our programs terminate suddenly.

Exception handling
    - it is a mechanism that allows us to avoid runtime errors and helps us convert
      complex error messages to something simpler that a normal human can understand

How to implement Exception handling
    - keywords: try, catch, finally, throw, throws

try block of code
    - inside the try block of code, we write the code that may put out an exception
    - put problematic code in here

catch block of code
    - the catch block of code contains the backup code that we want to excecute in case of failure.
      can also contain the code to simplify error messages. can also contain code that might send a
      notification or email to a developer or admin in case of a failure
    -

how it works
    - we can have many catch blocks with one try block. each catch block handling a different error
    - we can also put a last catch block with the Exception class so that if something goes wrong that
      wasn't anticipated, it will catch that error

finally block of code
    - finally block is always executed no matter what happens in the try block or the catch block
    - we should put cleanup code here like closing a browser, closing the database connection etc.

Handling exceptions in the console
    - the console gives you certain info when you have an exception
        - tells you what exception it is
        - basic description of the problem
        - the code that caused the problem
    - sometimes the console will give you several lines of code that caused the problem
      which is the stack trace. When reading this, start from the line of code at the
      bottom of the console, and as you work through them to the top, you should find the
      source of the problem

- throw keyword allows us to put out an exception explicitly
- throws keyword lets us give the problem to someone else
  (we are throwing the problem to someone else)

Three main types of issues in java programs
    - Syntax error, logical error, exceptions(runtime errors)

    - Syntax error: occur when java syntax is not followed for ex: when we create a variable we have to specify its type.
      these errors don't allow us to compile the code
    - logical errors: occur when programs don't do what we expect them to do for ex: we write code to click a button,
      but it actually clicks a checkbox
    - exceptions(runtime errors): occur when code compiles fine but when you run the program, it throws errors.
      These are fixed by reading the exception that is put out in the console and go to the class of that exception
