Constructor recap:
    It's a block of code similar to a method that is executed when we create an object

    Why do we need it?: constructor initialises the object

This keyword:
    is used to refer to the current object
    'this' can be used with variables & methods.

    'this' is used to refer to CURRENT instance variables in situations where
    local variable has same name as instance variable, we use 'this' keyword
    to differentiate and refer to the instance variable version

    - this keyword can also refer to CURRENT instance methods

    this() - can be used to call CURRENT class constructor

Inheritance
    is a mechanism where one class acquires all the methods an attributes of a parent class.
    The idea behind it is we can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.
    'extends' is the keyword used to inherit the variables/methods of a class.

    3 types of inheritance:
    1) single: One parent class, one sub class
    2) multi-level: One parent class, one sub class, one sub-sub class etc.
    3) Hierarchal: One parent class, many sub classes

    - this keyword refers to the CURRENT class's instance variables and methods
    - this() is used to call the CURENT class's constructor
