ArrayList vs. Array

    ArrayList gives us access to a lot of methods that are already made that we can use
    instead of us having to create those methods on our own. (its better
    to reuse than to make a new method).

    - The Java Developers code is way more efficient and optimized compared
      to our code because they have decades of experience.

    Also, the sizes of arrays that already created are fixed, we can't add to that
    array later on in a program. But ArrayList allows us to add data because the size
    of an ArrayList is not fixed. we don't need to specify size for ArrayList (but we could)
    - Overall, ArrayList gives you more flexibility than regular arrays and
      it's overall better than arrays. But regular arrays are faster and saves more memory.
      Array occupies 4x less memory than ArrayList.

      (if you want speed/memory, go with array.) usually not the case
      (if you want flexibility, go with ArrayList)

    ArrayList is more intelligent in the way when we run code, it will grow itself
    if required, it can also shrink itself to save memory

    - if we want to replace something in ArrayList, use set() method
Wrapper class

    Wrapper class in java provides the mechanism to
    convert  primitive  into  object  and  object  into
    primitive.
    - it allows us to use primitives as a reference type so we
      have access to the methods that are in the wrapper class

    - For each primitive data type, java devs created a class for each data type
      that acts as a replica because ArrayList doesn't support primitive data types
      which is why you need to put a class name inside the diamond operators
      int = Integer
      char = Character
      boolean = Boolean
      etc.

Collection framework

    allows us to collect and store multiple objects in a single variable.
    the ArrayList is just one class thats a part of the Collection Framework

Note:
    - the only difference between for loop and while loop is,
      for loop is easier to read. The explanation that for loop is only
      used when you know exact number of iterations is problematic. while loops
      can do the same thing a for loop can do

    - Java is 99% Object oriented programming because the 1% is the
      primitive data types like int, boolean, char which are primitive data types
